This directory contains data collected for "Entity Linking for Spoken
Language" (NAACL 2015, forthcoming).  Also included are all named entity
annotations used for evaluation in "OOV Sensitive Named-Entity Recognition
in Speech" (INTERSPEECH, 2011), of which a subset were annotated with
knowledge base entities.  The utterances were drawn from the HUB4
dataset https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC98S71 , and the knowledge base is
the same Wikipedia dump used in the TAC 2009 KBP track.
